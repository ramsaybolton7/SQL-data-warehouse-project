## 🚀 Project Requirements
### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
• **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

• **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

• **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

• **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

• **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

• **Customer Behavior**

• **Product Performance**

• **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
